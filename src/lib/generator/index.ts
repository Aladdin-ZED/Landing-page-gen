 *   remixDoc(doc, { seed, scope })   new take on a page: "design" | "layout" | "copy" | "all"
 *   suggestBundles(price, currency…) ×1 / ×2 / ×3 packs with charming prices
 *   rankDirections(input)            archetypes for the product, mood-aware ("other styles" too)
 *   readMood / copyCategory          the product's mood (calm / lively / neutral) and its copy family
 *
 * Every generated theme is free of orange (owner rule: OKLCH hue 25°–75° above 0.06 chroma, see
 * theme.ts); a calm product (modest wear, soft materials, pale photos) only gets quiet directions.
