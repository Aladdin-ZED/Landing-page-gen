 * it, the result is stored, and from then on the builder canvas, every published version and every
 * export crop the image around its subject — all from the same stored row.
 *
 * Input is the same as the backfill's: the largest stored still rendition (the processed master,
 * EXIF-rotated and trimmed for cutouts — the pixels the upload analysed). One analysis per asset at a
