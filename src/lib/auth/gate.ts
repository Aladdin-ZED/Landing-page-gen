/**
 * Secret admin gate.
 * Visiting "/<ADMIN_GATE>" issues a signed, HttpOnly gate cookie; without a valid one every admin
 * URL answers like an unknown page. With ADMIN_HOST set, all of this works on that host only. The signature binds the issue time and a fingerprint of the
 * current ADMIN_GATE value, so rotating ADMIN_GATE (or APP_SECRET) invalidates every gate cookie.
 * The cookie slides: the proxy re-issues it once it is a day old, so a browser in regular use
 * keeps its access; one unused for GATE_TTL_MS has to visit the gate path again.
 *
 * No Next.js request APIs here: this module runs inside src/proxy.ts as well as in server code.
