/**
 * Steps — how the product is used (or how ordering works), in four modern compositions:
 *  timeline     a rail that fills with the scroll, nodes lighting up as the line reaches them
 *  cards        frosted glass cards on a staircase, giant numerals diffused through the glass
 *  illustrated  masked plates (photo, or a glass lens over a sphere of the product's color) linked by smooth curves
 *  strip        measured frames with a progress track: swipe strip on phones, grid on wide screens
