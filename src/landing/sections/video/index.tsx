/**
 * Video — the product moving, three modern compositions:
 *  framed     landscape clips: a cinematic frame across the container with the chapters on a frosted
 *             glass dock straddling its bottom edge; vertical clips: a tall frame breaking out of a
 *             panel of its own blurred light (concentric arches on arch themes) beside the copy
 *  phone      a vertical customer video in a modern phone with story chrome (creator, verified pill,
 *             their words), standing on a disc of the product's light, turning gently on scroll,
 *             frosted COD chips over its edges
 *  fullbleed  a film edge to edge, opening from an inset card as it scrolls in, the headline and a
 *             hairline chapter bar over it; film-first on phones; vertical clips become a tall panel
 *             over a field of their own light on desktop
 * Chapters run on segmented tracks: the playhead fills them in turn and lights the current one.
 * The file plays muted and looped while visible (runtime [data-autoplay]); without a video the
 * poster / product photo holds the frame with a slow drift. Creator name, city and words are
 * merchant proof: defaults are samples flagged `sample: true`.
