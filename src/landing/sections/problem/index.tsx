/**
 * Problem — the everyday pains the product ends, then the turn to the product. Four modern views:
 *  crossed  redline ledger: each pain struck by one clean accent line, its fix written in under it;
 *           it ends on the one line left standing, the product inset in the type as an image pill
 *  chat     the pains as the shopper's messages in a glass conversation card; the shop answers with
 *           a product card (photo, glass price tag, solution, order button)
 *  split    recessed "Sans" vs raised, vivid "Avec" panels bridged by a half-desaturated product photo
 *  quote    one huge statement with a highlight block on the key words; pains as a quiet index and a
 *           raised answer card with the product
