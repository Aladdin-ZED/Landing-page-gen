/**
 * FAQ — the questions every COD shopper asks before ordering (payment, delivery, inspecting the
 * parcel, exchanges) plus the product's own, answered in the brand's voice:
 *  accordion  a hairline list of big questions; the open one lifts into a raised card, +/− morph
 *  two-col    sticky heading + question index beside article-like answers, a reading rail that fills
 *  chat       a brand messenger: question bubbles, answers that arrive typing, a composer that
 *             opens WhatsApp
 * Every variant closes with "still a question?" on the store's channel (WhatsApp, else phone).
 * Views live in their own files; this one holds the definition (defaults, inspector, render).
