/**
 * Reviews — customer voices, four modern compositions:
 *  wall      bento: lead quote + color score tile with the product, then a bento of wide/narrow cards
 *            (a swipe rail on phones)
 *  carousel  one large quote at a time on a raised panel; the reviewers' faces are the pagination
 *  summary   honest review module: gauge ring score, real distribution bars, the product, feed of the
 *            best reviews
 *  notes     "stack": a swipeable deck of cards with depth (variant id kept for saved pages)
 * Reviews are merchant content: defaults are product-aware samples flagged `sample: true`.
