# COD Studio: project handoff

Everything a new session (or a new engineer) needs to continue this project without the original chat.
Last updated 2026-10-23, at commit `b995a48` plus this document.

## 1. What this is

COD Studio has two parts:

- **Public product landing pages** for cash-on-delivery (COD) sales. They are art-directed per product vibe,
  rendered to static HTML at publish, and sell through an order form, bundles/offers, pixels and Google Sheets.
- **A private admin.** It generates the page design from product photos, using a local in-browser AI with a
  rule-based fallback, and a full builder to edit, version, publish and export pages.

| | |
|---|---|
| Owner | COD seller, Morocco first (Arabic/Darija + French, MAD), Europe later. Writes in non-native English: answer plainly. |
| Live site | **https://myrizq.shop** on Hostinger Business (managed Node.js) |
| Real repo | **https://github.com/Aladdin-ZED/Landing-page-gen** (`main`; this PC pushes as `Aladdin-ZED`) |
| Stack | Next.js 16.4 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19.3, TS strict, Zod v4, Drizzle + mysql2 on MariaDB 10.4, Tailwind v4 (admin, precompiled), shadcn/ui |
| Docs | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/SECTIONS.md`, **`docs/OFFERS.md`** (Offers v2 spec, the contract for offers/items/options/pixels), `docs/DEPLOY-HOSTINGER.md`, `docs/GOOGLE-SHEETS-SETUP.md`, `README.md` |

## 2. Owner rules (always apply)

1. **No orange, ever,** in the admin or the landing pages: no colour with OKLCH hue 25–75° and chroma > 0.06
   (red-orange, coral, terracotta, amber, ochre). Beige/sand neutrals are fine. Crimson (< 25°) and yellow/gold
   (> 75°) are fine. New colour mixes must be registered with the blend guard (`src/lib/theme/blend.ts`).
   Checks: `qa/verify/orange-check.mjs` and `qa/admin-visual/shoot.mjs --scan-only`.
2. **Design must be maximally modern, smooth and precise,** with no vintage/craft motifs and no generic AI look:
   precise spacing and alignment, intentional compositions, premium states, perfect RTL. See `docs/DESIGN.md`
   (banned list, §9 precision checklist, §10 budgets).
3. **Autonomy:** once a direction is approved, keep going and make the decisions yourself. Report them at the end.
   For big architecture changes, write a spec first (see `docs/OFFERS.md`, which went through a 3-lens review).
4. Natural Arabic copy (Darija-friendly for Morocco), French and English. Never invent prices, ratings, stock
   or reviews.
5. Secrets: never print, commit or paste `.env.local`, `.env.hostinger*` or tokens. Never type passwords or
   tokens into web forms for the owner: tell them where to paste them.

## 3. Local development (Windows PC)

- `npm run dev` runs `scripts/dev.mjs`: next dev on **port 3400** plus the admin Tailwind watcher. Port 3400 is
  the owner's dev server: don't kill it. Use other ports (3401+) for test servers.
- Database: XAMPP MariaDB 10.4 at 127.0.0.1:3306, user `root`, no password, `max_allowed_packet` 1 MB.
  `CREATE USER` crashes it, so use root. Start it detached:
  `Start-Process C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe --defaults-file=C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini --standalone`.
  The local dev database is `cod_studio`. Migrations run automatically at boot (`src/instrumentation.ts`).
- PHP CLI (export parity tests): `C:\xampp\php\php.exe`.
- Playwright: launch with `channel: "msedge"`, because the Chromium download fails on this network.
- npm installs are very slow here. Avoid adding packages.
- `.env.local` holds local dev env and E2E owner credentials. It is git-ignored, so copy it by hand to clones.
- `qa/` is **git-ignored** (≈600 MB: harnesses plus screenshots), so copy it by hand to clones. It contains the
  e2e harness (`qa/e2e/run.mjs`, 17 steps), `qa/verify/*` (render matrix, orange, pixel, bidi checks),
  `qa/final-verify/geom-check.ts` and `qa/admin-visual/shoot.mjs`.
- Main checks: `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` · `npm test` (theme, runtime selftests + parity, generator, render-check
  with runtime budgets, money parity, conversions, offers-check, orders) · `npm run test:pixels` ·
  `npm run test:php` · `npm run build` (Turbopack; `|| next build --webpack` fallback).
- Landing assets: `node scripts/build-landing-assets.mjs` writes `src/landing/generated/*` (committed). Admin
  CSS: `node scripts/build-admin-css.mjs` writes `src/app/globals.compiled.css` (committed). Both run in
  prebuild/predev.

## 4. Production on Hostinger

| | |
|---|---|
| Website | `myrizq.shop`. It was renamed from `maroon-kangaroo-224471.hostingersite.com` on 2026-10-17, and the old address no longer resolves. |
| hPanel user | `u641677794` · Node **22** · preset Next.js · build `npm run build` · output `.next` (Hostinger applies `output: standalone` itself) |
| Database | `u641677794_codstudio02` / user `u641677794_codadmin02` on **127.0.0.1** (localhost can resolve to ::1) |
| Env vars | DATABASE_URL, APP_SECRET (**never change after launch**), ADMIN_GATE, SETUP_TOKEN, PUBLIC_URL (**= https://myrizq.shop**), TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=1, BEHIND_CLOUDFLARE=0, CRON_KEY, APP_TIMEZONE=Africa/Casablanca. The values are in the local git-ignored `.env.hostinger`. Comments at its top give the admin link, the cron line and the steps. |
| Admin | Hidden: `/admin` answers 404 until the owner opens `https://myrizq.shop/<ADMIN_GATE>`, which sets the gate cookie and redirects. |
| Cron | hPanel → Advanced → Cron Jobs, every 5 min: `curl -fsS --max-time 110 "https://myrizq.shop/api/cron/tick?key=<CRON_KEY>" > /dev/null` |

### Why git pushes do not deploy

Hostinger's GitHub app is installed on another GitHub account, **aladdinzed35**. Creating the site from the
public repo URL made a **snapshot copy** there (`aladdinzed35/landingPage-gen`, one "Initial commit").
Hostinger watches that copy, so pushes to `Aladdin-ZED/Landing-page-gen` never reach it. To make pushes
auto-deploy, the owner would have to give `Aladdin-ZED` push access to that copy, or connect the right repo.

### How to deploy (working method, about 2 minutes)

This needs the **Hostinger MCP connector** connected in Claude. If it says "sign in again", the owner
reconnects it in the Claude connector settings.

1. Commit and push to `origin main`.
2. Run `git archive --format=zip -o app.zip HEAD`. It contains tracked files only, so no secrets.
3. Hostinger MCP: `hosting_files_generate-upload-url` {username `u641677794`, domain `myrizq.shop`}. It
   returns url, auth_key and rest_auth_key.
4. `UP_URL=… UP_AUTH=… UP_REST=… bash scripts/deploy/hostinger-upload.sh app.zip cod-<random hex>.zip`
   uploads over TUS into public_html. Use a random file name.
5. Hostinger MCP: `hosting_nodejs_start-build` {node_version 22, app_type next, root_directory "",
   output_directory .next, build_script build, package_manager npm, source_type archive,
   source_options {archive_path: "<that name>"}}.
6. Poll `hosting_nodejs_build` / `hosting_nodejs_build-logs`. A build takes about 80 s. The log must show the
   line `[admin-css] COD Studio build: admin Tailwind precompiled…`. "Syncing public_html" removes the archive.
   A failed build keeps the previous version live.
7. Smoke test:
   - `/` returns 200
   - `/admin` returns 404
   - `/<ADMIN_GATE>` returns 303 to `/admin`
   - `POST /api/public/order {}` answers `{"ok":false,"error":"invalid",…}`
   - cron with the `X-Cron-Key` header answers `{"ok":true…}`

hPanel "Redeploy" reuses the source of the **last** build. After an archive deploy it rebuilds that archive,
so it's safe. It would rebuild the old snapshot only if the last build came from git.

### Hard-won lessons

- **Turbopack's CSS loaders run in spawned Node workers, which Hostinger kills** ("node process exited before we
  could connect"). So: no `postcss.config`, no `turbopack.rules`. Admin Tailwind is precompiled by
  `scripts/build-admin-css.mjs`.
- **PUBLIC_URL must equal the live domain.** The order API origin check, admin CSRF, the landing CSP
  (connect-src/form-action) and absolute media/canonical URLs all use it. After a domain change: update the env
  var, rebuild, then **republish every live page** (published HTML is static and embeds the old domain).
- MariaDB `max_allowed_packet`: publish splits the version row into three statements and refuses with
  `page_too_large` when it's still too big (Hostinger allows 16 MB, XAMPP 1 MB).
- `onnxruntime-node` CUDA download is skipped through `.npmrc` (`onnxruntime-node-install=skip`).
- Client IP: X-Forwarded-For is walked from the right and internal hops are skipped. The owner can verify in
  Settings → Security → "Visitor IP check" and set TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=2 if their IP shows as hop 2.

## 5. Feature map (where things live)

- **Theme engine:** `src/lib/theme`. 11 archetypes, OKLCH palettes, contrast guarantees, no-orange guard,
  calm-mood logic.
- **Landing:** `src/landing/**`. 27 section types, ~88 variants, per-variant CSS chunks. Runtime in
  `src/landing/runtime` (hashed chunks: core, thanks, pixels, turnstile, feature chunks). Budgets are enforced
  by render-check: landing 24,200 B gz, thanks 6,650 B, page cap 32,000 B. They sit at the limit.
- **Offers v2** (`docs/OFFERS.md`):
  - Items: 1–8 per page, with photos cropped from group photos (`AssetRef.box`).
  - Line-based offers: fixed item or customer's choice, free lines, lock/allow/preset rules, perks, gifts,
    composed or custom visuals.
  - Options: choice, matrix (color × size) and typed fields, with price deltas and Latin codes.
  - Display axes: picker stack/tiers/ticket/pills/visual, fill inline/rows/steps/box/auto, selection
    soft/solid/outline.
  - Integer-cent pricing shared by server, runtime and the PHP export.
  - Order payload v2 with version + shown total, and a stale flow.
- **Per-page pixels** (Meta ×3, TikTok ×3, Snap, GA4): Settings → Pixels is a library (ids, labels, tokens,
  test codes, health, usage). Every page answers explicitly (pixels or "No pixel").
  - Browser funnel: PageView, ViewContent, AddToCart (first pack choice / form interaction),
    InitiateCheckout, Lead (valid phone), **Purchase on the thank-you page** (event id = order id).
  - Server Purchase goes through the Meta Conversions API and the TikTok Events API (`src/lib/orders/conversions*`).
  - **Server events are skipped when the order risk score ≥ 70** (`src/lib/orders/risk.ts`: duplicate phone,
    repeated IP, cancelled history, too fast…), so owner test orders often don't reach Meta.
  - Brave and ad blockers block the browser pixel.
- **Orders:** `src/lib/orders` (contract, validate, resolve, create, text v2, risk), Google Sheets sync
  (`src/lib/sheets`), admin orders (`src/components/admin/orders`), exports (`src/lib/export`: connected / PHP
  / WhatsApp).
- **Admin:** generate wizard (`src/components/generate`: Photos → Analysis → Details → Offers → Directions with
  the pixel gate), builder (`src/components/builder`, panels Product & items / Offers / SEO + pixels / …),
  settings, security (TOTP 2FA, sessions, rate limits, AES-GCM secret settings, hidden gate).
- **Local AI:** `@huggingface/transformers`, Qwen-class VLM + SigLIP + background removal in the browser, with a
  rule-based copy library fallback (`src/lib/ai`).

## 6. Status and open items (2026-10-23)

Live and verified: Offers v2, per-page pixels, order outputs, PHP/WhatsApp exports, domain myrizq.shop.

The owner still has to:
- **Republish the live page** in the admin. Its HTML still has 9 links to the old maroon-kangaroo domain
  (canonical, og/twitter image, JSON-LD).
- Verify the Meta **Conversions API token** with "Send test event" (Settings → Pixels → RIZQ), then **remove the
  test code**.
- Place one real order from Chrome or the Facebook app (not Brave), with a never-used phone and ≥ 10 s filling
  the form, so **Achat / Purchase** shows in Events Manager. Then pick it as the ad set's conversion event.
- Verify the domain `myrizq.shop` in Meta Business (Brand safety → Domains). Update the cron URL. Check the
  Visitor IP check.
- Connect Google Sheets (`docs/GOOGLE-SHEETS-SETUP.md`). Optional: admin on `studio.myrizq.shop` + `ADMIN_HOST`.

Suggested next engineering items:
- Show "Sent to Meta ✓ / skipped (risk N)" per order in the admin order drawer.
- Don't write a kept default no-cost extra ("Sans emballage") into the Sheets Variante or thank-you text.
  This needs an idle marker with parity across `text.ts`, `order.php` and the runtime.
- Runtime budget headroom: the landing chunk is within 30 bytes of its budget.
- Run the `scripts/qa/upgrade-dry-run.ts` gate against a production DB dump.
- Make published HTML domain-independent (relative media URLs; re-render live pages automatically when
  PUBLIC_URL changes).
- Leave the other Hostinger sites alone: `gold-squirrel-622612` and `lime-otter-714875` are other projects.
  `lightgray-hedgehog-192293` is an abandoned failed copy of this one and can be deleted when the owner agrees.

## 7. Working method that worked

- Big work goes through multi-agent workflows: spec → 3-lens review → parallel tracks with strict file
  ownership (see `docs/OFFERS.md` §I.6) → adversarial verification → fix loop.
- Network outages here kill agents (ENOTFOUND). Wrap agents with retries and resume from the working tree.
- Before deploying: typecheck, `npm test`, a build, a production smoke test on a throwaway DB (port ≥ 3401),
  then the archive deploy above, then a live smoke test.
